The objective of this research is to investigate fracture mechanisms of asphalt concrete by employing a synergistic approach combining digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE) techniques under three-point bending tests. Firstly, the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) and the fracture process zone (FPZ) derived from DIC were utilized to classify fracture stages and describe the entire crack propagation process. Meanwhile, AE-related parameters were applied to detect the internal damage and fracture characteristics. Subsequently, the results from DIC and AE were utilized for comparative analysis to evaluate the cracking resistance of different materials. Finally, the fractal dimension and AE b-value were used to distinguish the characteristics of the critical damage conditions. The results indicated that both techniques are effective in classifying the fracture stage of asphalt concrete. DIC can visualize and analyze crack propagation processes and paths on concrete surfaces, especially at the stage of macrocrack initiation and propagation. AE allows for continuous monitoring and highly sensitive detection of early-stage damage inside concrete. The distinct advantages of DIC and AE result in different fracture stage identification results at the early stage, but consistent after the appearance of macrocracks. Based on the relationship between CTOD and AE cumulative count, a simple approach is proposed to directly evaluate the cracking resistance of different asphalt concretes. The formation of macrocracks in asphalt concrete can be reflected by a shift where the correlation dimension drops steeply to the minimum value, and a minimum inflection point in the AE b-value curve acts as a precursor of complete fracture. The research offers an in-depth insight of both surface deformation and internal damage, thus enhancing the understanding of crack growth behavior and fracture process in asphalt concrete. ",

Its composition, primarily a mixture of aggregates and asphalt binder, is designed to endure a variety of stresses from traffic and environmental conditions.

These phenomena not only compromise the structural integrity of pavements but also significantly reduce their lifespan, leading to increased maintenance costs and safety concerns.

Specifically, Meng et al. [4] reviewed that the SCB test can effectively evaluate the crack resistance of asphalt mixtures by adjusting the geometric size and test parameters of the semi-cylindrical sample. This evaluation uses fracture indexes like fracture energy, fracture toughness, stiffness, and flexibility, in addition to observing the crack growth. Additionally, imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and scanning lasers are employed to measure subtle deformations and characterize fractures in asphalt concrete. For instance, Hassan et al. [5] characterized the internal structural damage of asphalt concretes captured on X-ray CT images. Ajideh et al. [6] developed a scanning laser system designed to detect changes in surface properties for the purposes of monitoring damage and characterizing the fatigue behavior of asphalt concretes. While these methods can reflect the trend of crack onset and progression in asphalt concrete, they are inadequate in dynamically perceiving the entire damage process, which constrains their effectiveness in exploring the fracture behavior and mechanisms of concretes. In addition, researchers have employed various numerical simulation techniques, such as boundary element method (BEM), discrete element method (DEM) and finite element method (FEM), to identify crack initiation and propagation [7–11]. Specifically, Elseifi et al. [12] reviewed FEM method of modelling crack initiation and propagation in flexible pavements. Based on this review, a knowledge base has been established on how FEM can be effectively applied to predict pavement performance against cracking failure mechanisms. While these simulation methods are effective in certain scenarios, they may not always provide precise predictions of the fracture process, particularly in more complex or varying conditions. The accuracy of these models can be influenced by factors such as the simulation scale, the material model used, and the complexity of the concrete structure being analyzed. ",

It enhances the understanding of fracture behaviors in material structures by offering full-field, non-destructive, and detailed surface measurements of displacement and strain [13–15]. Seo et al. [16] compared the measurements of DIC against conventional linear variable differential transformers (LVDT), and found that DIC provides a more accurate determination of the stress–strain behavior due to its full-field and post-processing characteristics. DIC can offer a deformation map for the surface crack and measure displacement, allowing for the extraction of crack location and detection [17]. Zhu et al. [18] utilized DIC to evaluate crack initiation time, crack propagation rate, and horizontal strain through fatigue and bending fracture tests to study the self-healing properties of open-graded friction course (OGFC) asphalt concrete. Furthermore, DIC accurately measures strain fields in materials, detecting anomalies and damages. Doll et al. [19] employed DIC to estimate the FPZ in SCB specimens of asphalt concrete with a prefabricated notch through three-point bending tests by measuring the strain field around the crack tip. Bhowmik et al. [20] applied DIC to monitor the fracture process of concrete under different loading conditions and proposed a systematic method to understand the characteristics of the FPZ in concrete components. Overall, the ability of DIC to provide detailed information about crack growth and behavior renders it a valuable tool in the study and characterization of material cracks. ",

        "text": "Compared with DIC, which focuses on surface deformation, AE technique offers superior capabilities in detecting internal damage and provides insights into internal processes as a precise and continuous non-destructive testing method. AE signals are the elastic waves propagating from the release of localized internal energy, such as microfractures in concrete. The AE technique, which detects these signals, is highly effective for real-time monitoring of damage progression and localizing fractures, thereby enabling the analysis of damage mechanisms [21–23]. Fundamentally, AE parameters have proven effective in evaluating concrete damage under various conditions [24,25]. Geng et al. [26] observed that the AE energy and ringing counts of concrete during the uniaxial compression test exhibited three distinct stages, which were found to align closely with the primary stages of deformation and failure. Further research based on AE parameters in the context of concrete structures is also emphasized for the analysis and evaluation of concrete failure processes, with the objective of comprehensive discrimination and characterization of the failure process. Typically, Ohtsu et al. [27] and Colombo et al. [28] employed b-value to evaluate the damage severity of concrete structures. Sagar et al. [29] analyzed the amplitude distribution of AE to study fracture propagation in concrete and mortar specimens, and indicated that b-value based on AE provides an effective method for identifying damage in concrete structural components. Additionally, a series of nonlinear theories and models were used to analyze the AE parameters and waveforms. For instance, a proposed methodology, based on the principles of fractal theory, has been put forward to forecast the progression of damage and the duration until structural failure. This methodology establishes a connection between the concepts of fracture mechanics and AE for structures that have been subjected to diffused damage [22]. Qiu et al. [30] conducted computations to determine the box-counting dimensions of different AE parameters, thus illustrating that the fractal dimension can consistently unveil the bending failure attributes of asphalt concrete. Ali et al. [31] indicated that the sudden decrease in the correlation dimension of AE signals enables to predict dynamic failures and microcrack mechanisms in coal and rock. Overall, AE techniques have proven highly effective in detecting and identifying crack initiation, monitoring crack propagation, and characterizing fracture mechanisms for concrete materials. ",

The combined use of DIC and AE techniques has emerged as a powerful method, providing valuable insights into the initiation, propagation, and failure mechanisms of fractures, making them indispensable tools in material science and engineering research [32–34]. Li et al. [35] explored damage and failure of rubberized self-compacting concrete (RSCC) when subjected to uniaxial tension, employing both AE and DIC methods. Guo et al. [36] examined the fracture behavior of beams made from recycled concrete under three-point bending conditions, through the simultaneous application of DIC and AE methodologies. The combination allows for simultaneous temporal (time-based) monitoring of cracking events (AE) and spatial (location-based) analysis of deformation (DIC), which is significant for understanding the dynamics of fracture processes in concrete. The combined use of DIC and AE has shown promise in the study of materials, but more research is still needed to fully explore its potential. Most existing research focuses on specific types of materials, and it is necessary to understand how the combined use of DIC and AE can be applied to a wider range of materials, particularly asphalt concretes with different viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, while both DIC and AE offer insights into material damage, their relationship is still not fully understood. Further investigation utilizing the correlation between the results of these two techniques studies is needed to respond to the material properties and mechanical characteristics.

Upon reaching the peak load, the opening displacement at the notch tip reached the critical value $w _ { c }$ , signifying a fully developed FPZ. The fully developed FPZ lengths for NA, SBS, and HVMA concretes were approximately $7 . 3 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , $9 . 4 3 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $1 4 . 0 7 9 \\mathrm { m m }$ , respectively, as shown in Figs. 6–8 (2).

Combined with the results presented in Section 3.1, concretes with better cracking resistance tend to have larger fully developed FPZ lengths and higher critical COD. This suggests a strong correlation between the viscoelastic properties of asphalt materials and both the FPZ length and critical COD. This inference is consistent with the conclusion by Doll et al. [19] that material embrittlement occurs concurrently with a decrease in the size of the FPZ. It is commonly believed that the size of the FPZ influences the material’s fracture toughness. A larger FPZ allows the material to absorb more energy before fracturing, thereby exhibiting higher fracture toughness. Consequently, SBS concrete and HVMA concrete demonstrate superior cracking resistance compared to the NA concrete. ",

Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of AE parameters was performed to explore the characteristic patterns of concrete internal cracking behaviors at various development stages. Figs. 9–11 present a comparative analysis of the temporal evolution of AE parameters for three different materials over time. It was observed that counts, cumulative count, energy, and cumulative energy exhibit distinct stage-specific characteristics for each material. Notably, a sudden increase in these parameters tend to occur simultaneous for a given material, suggesting transitions in the damage process. The damage process is preliminarily categorized into four stages based on three simultaneous abrupt changes: specimen deformation (Stage I), microcrack initiation and concentration (Stage II), macroscopic crack formation and stable expansion (Stage III), and macroscopic crack unstable expansion (Stage IV). The damage behavior of each stage inferred from the AE parameters is detailed as follows. ",

In this phase, although the overall number of AE events diminishes significantly, each event is characterized by increased count and energy levels. This suggests that at this stage, instances of crack formation or expansion are frequently linked with significant energy release, reflecting a transition in the specimen’s damage state from microscopic to macroscopic cracking. Furthermore, after the peak load is reached, a linear decline in the loading curve is observed, especially evident in the NA specimen. Following the linear decline, the damage evolution advances into Stage IV. In this stage, AE activity significantly decreases in both count and energy, returning to levels similar to Stage II. This reduction in AE activity corresponds with the expansion of macroscopic cracks. Simultaneously, the growth of cumulative AE energy and count levels off, suggesting a stabilization phase in the damage progression. Cracks and defects within concrete significantly impact its mechanical properties. The AE process in loaded concrete is governed by its internal structure and changes therein. Additionally, AE signals provide extensive information about internal structural changes. A detailed analysis of cumulative AE energy, amplitude, and count rate effectively characterizes the dynamic damage process of asphalt concrete, categorizing it into four distinct stages. Abrupt simultaneous changes in AE parameters serve as criteria for assessing transitions in asphalt concrete damage behavior. Therefore, it is reasonable to evaluate the fracture performance of asphalt concrete based on the critical points between these damage stages. ",

AE excels in early damage detection, identifying minor internal defects before they are visible, placing its initial stages I to stage II within DIC’s stage 1. This shows that early-stage damage detected by AE often corresponds to DIC’s stage 1, demonstrating a significant overlap in their early damage detection capabilities.

Initially, prior to the peak load $\\mathrm { ( F _ { m a x } ) }$ , there is a marked increase in the normalized cumulative count alongside a rise in normalized CTOD, suggesting a linear and positive correlation. This pattern implies that substantial internal structural changes and damages have occurred before visible cracks appear on the specimen’s surface, highlighting the advanced capability of AE technique for early damage detection, particularly for internal damages. Upon reaching the $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ,$ the curve shifts to a nonlinear growth phase, where the rate of increase in AE events no longer directly correlate with the crack growth rate. This shift in the crack growth mode, possibly due to the coalescence of multiple microcracks into larger cracks, may account for the observed deceleration in growth rate. In the terminal phase, the normalized cumulative count plateaus near a normalized value of 1.0, while the normalized cumulative count growth rate approaches zero, thereby forming a horizontal asymptote. This indicates that the crack has traversed the majority of the material, and the diminishing generation of AE events may signify that the crack is nearing complete fracture. As elasticity increases, the curves demonstrate a more pronounced deviation from the initial linear correlation between CTOD and cumulative count, with the SBS and HVMA concretes showing a distinctly nonlinear behavior, especially after the peak load.

Materials with higher normalized cumulative counts at a given normalized CTOD value generally exhibit better cracking resistance because higher AE counts indicate more energy is being absorbed by the materials before failure. As shown in Fig. 12, despite similar normalized CTOD values at $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ,$ three concretes show varying normalized cumulative counts. The HVMA concrete, with the best cracking resistance, has the highest normalized cumulative count, followed by SBS concrete, while NA concrete has the lowest. Furthermore, at a specific normalized cumulative count value, a lower normalized CTOD value implies stronger cracking resistance. As the normalized cumulative count approaches the horizontal asymptote at the end of the non-linear stage, the corresponding normalized CTOD reflects the concrete’s cracking resistance. As depicted in Fig. 12, the HVMA concrete, with the best cracking resistance, has the smallest normalized CTOD, followed by SBS concrete, while the NA records the largest.

        "text": "The fracture failure of asphalt concrete can generally be interpreted as a progressive transformation. This progression transitions from a state of disorder to order. Correspondingly, this is mirrored in the evolution of AE that is linked with the deformation and material damage failure. It is generally considered that a decrease in the correlation dimension signifies an increase in the orderliness of the AE process. This transition from a random to an ordered state is externally manifested during the testing process through the observation of microcracks, concentration of fissures, and formation of microcrack zones. The damage phases delineated by the AE parameters (Figs. 9–11) and the changes in the correlation dimension showed good correlation. The stage I and stage II, defined based on AE parameters, correspond to the specimen deformation phase and the microcrack nucleation and concentration phase, respectively. During Stage I, the initial voids within the specimen close, and some rough surfaces make contact or rub against each other, generating AE signals. In Stage II, the random formation of microcracks within the specimen results in the release of more AE signals. The generation of these two types of AE signals is random and lacks a clear pattern, thereby increasing the disorderliness of the failure forms. Consequently, the correlation dimension D experienced varying degrees of increase during these two phases. As the internal damage of the specimen progressed, there was a notable decrease in the correlation dimension D, signifying a more orderly internal damage pattern at this stage, potentially suggestive of macrocrack formation. This shift implies that the damage was predominantly extending and expanding on a larger scale. Notably, the moments of the rapid decline in the correlation dimension D appear to correlate with the cracking resistance characteristics of asphalt concrete. Improved cracking resistance results in the point of rapid decline being closer to $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } }$ . Therefore, the viscoelastic properties of the asphalt material play a significant role in asphalt cracking resistance. ",

During this process, the correlation dimension D entered a fluctuating state, highlighting the complexity of the damage evolution process during this stage. The existence of larger aggregates impedes the direct upward propagation of cracks within the specimen to. During loading, the interaction or friction between defects from microcracks in the FPZ and gaps from macrocracks in the FTZ generates AE signals. These signals exhibit a high degree of disordered. Conversely, the continuous expansion and propagation of macrocracks, which yield more orderly AE signals, coexist with this disorder. Together, they shape the fluctuation pattern of correlation dimension D. ",

Generally, the regular variation of the b-value across different stages of failure can serve as an indicator of material damage severity. A higher b-value corresponds to smaller amplitude impacts, which suggests a gradual initiation of cracks and a slower rate of propagation. On the other hand, a decrease in the bvalue implies a relative increase in larger amplitude AE impacts. This is indicative of faster and more unstable crack propagation, suggesting more severe material damage.

The improvement in Wf is associated with enhanced deformation resistance and cracking resistance of asphalt concrete.   \n(2) Concretes with better cracking resistance tend to exhibit longer fully developed FPZ lengths and higher critical COD, indicating a significant correlation between the viscoelastic properties of asphalt materials and both the FPZ length and critical COD. DIC offers high spatial resolution and accuracy in measuring surface displacements and strains, providing valuable insights into the fracture processes of asphalt concrete.   \n(3) The fracture process of asphalt concretes can be categorized into four stages based on the evolution pattern of AE parameters: specimen deformation stage, microcrack initiation and concentration stage, macroscopic crack formation and stable expansion stage, and macroscopic crack unstable expansion stage. Notably, the observation of sparse areas in the AE parameter evolution process is a special phenomenon that merits further exploration. In summary, AE is instrumental in determining cracking mechanisms in asphalt concrete and correlates with mechanical damage analysis.   \n(4) While the DIC and AE technique show varied early fracture stage identification in asphalt concretes, consistency emerges after the appearance of macrocracks. For a reliable measure of asphalt concrete’s cracking resistance, a three-phase correlation between normalized CTOD and AE cumulative count is observed. An increased normalized cumulative AE count at $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ and a decreased normalized CTOD at the end of nonlinear phase are key to assessing the cracking resilience of asphalt concretes.   \n(5) During the initial loading stage, a rising trend was observed in the correlation dimension D for all three materials, but a significant reduction in the correlation dimension D was observed prior to reaching $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ . Following this phase, the correlation dimension D exhibited a recovery of varying extents, subsequently transitioning into a phase characterized by unpredictable or oscillatory fluctuations. According to fractal theory, a steep decrease to the minimum value of the correlation dimension signifies the formation of macrocracks in asphalt concrete. Improved cracking resistance results in the point of rapid decline being closer to $\\operatorname { F } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ,$ suggesting that enhancing cracking resistance in asphalt materials can postpone the emergence of macrocracks.   \n(6) The AE b-value fluctuates with crack progression and generally ",
