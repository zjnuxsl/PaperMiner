# 4. Conclusions

This study utilizes DIC and AE techniques to enhance understanding of damage mechanisms in asphalt concrete. The main conclusions are presented as follows:

(1) The work of fracture (Wf) of asphalt concretes in this study ranks as $\mathrm { H V M A { > } S B S { > } N A }$ . The improvement in Wf is associated with enhanced deformation resistance and cracking resistance of asphalt concrete.   
(2) Concretes with better cracking resistance tend to exhibit longer fully developed FPZ lengths and higher critical COD, indicating a significant correlation between the viscoelastic properties of asphalt materials and both the FPZ length and critical COD. DIC offers high spatial resolution and accuracy in measuring surface displacements and strains, providing valuable insights into the fracture processes of asphalt concrete.   
(3) The fracture process of asphalt concretes can be categorized into four stages based on the evolution pattern of AE parameters: specimen deformation stage, microcrack initiation and concentration stage, macroscopic crack formation and stable expansion stage, and macroscopic crack unstable expansion stage. Notably, the observation of sparse areas in the AE parameter evolution process is a special phenomenon that merits further exploration. In summary, AE is instrumental in determining cracking mechanisms in asphalt concrete and correlates with mechanical damage analysis.   
(4) While the DIC and AE technique show varied early fracture stage identification in asphalt concretes, consistency emerges after the appearance of macrocracks. For a reliable measure of asphalt concrete’s cracking resistance, a three-phase correlation between normalized CTOD and AE cumulative count is observed. An increased normalized cumulative AE count at $\operatorname { F } _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ and a decreased normalized CTOD at the end of nonlinear phase are key to assessing the cracking resilience of asphalt concretes.   
(5) During the initial loading stage, a rising trend was observed in the correlation dimension D for all three materials, but a significant reduction in the correlation dimension D was observed prior to reaching $\operatorname { F } _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ . Following this phase, the correlation dimension D exhibited a recovery of varying extents, subsequently transitioning into a phase characterized by unpredictable or oscillatory fluctuations. According to fractal theory, a steep decrease to the minimum value of the correlation dimension signifies the formation of macrocracks in asphalt concrete. Improved cracking resistance results in the point of rapid decline being closer to $\operatorname { F } _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ,$ suggesting that enhancing cracking resistance in asphalt materials can postpone the emergence of macrocracks.   
(6) The AE b-value fluctuates with crack progression and generally

reaches its minimum at the end of macroscopic crack stable expansion stage or the start of unstable expansion stage. The presence of the minimum inflection point in the AE b-value curve serves as a precursor to the final failure in asphalt concrete. AE bvalue fluctuations offer insights into the intensity and progression of crack propagation, with implications for predicting final failure.

In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive examination of fracture progression in asphalt concrete, leveraging DIC and AE methodologies to enrich our insights into material behavior. The findings underscore the utility of these techniques in advancing the field of asphalt engineering and pave the way for future advancements in material analysis and design. Future research will explore the adaptation of these techniques for field applications, addressing challenges such as traffic noise through the development of targeted noise filtering algorithms, integration with other field-applicable pavement monitoring technologies, and strategic sensor placement to minimize noise interference.
