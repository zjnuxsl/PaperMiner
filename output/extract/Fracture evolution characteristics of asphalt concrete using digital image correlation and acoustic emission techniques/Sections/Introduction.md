# 1. Introduction

Asphalt concrete is widely used in pavement engineering and plays an important role in modern infrastructure. Its composition, primarily a mixture of aggregates and asphalt binder, is designed to endure a variety of stresses from traffic and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, during its service life, asphalt concrete is prone to deterioration due to cracking. These phenomena not only compromise the structural integrity of pavements but also significantly reduce their lifespan, leading to increased maintenance costs and safety concerns. Understanding the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation in asphalt concrete is crucial for improving its design and extending its service life.

Traditional mechanical testing methods, including the disk-shaped compact tension (DCT) test, semicircular bend (SCB) test, and fracture toughness test, have been extensively used to explore the correlation between material properties and mechanical behaviors of asphalt concrete [1–3]. Specifically, Meng et al. [4] reviewed that the SCB test can effectively evaluate the crack resistance of asphalt mixtures by adjusting the geometric size and test parameters of the semi-cylindrical sample. This evaluation uses fracture indexes like fracture energy, fracture toughness, stiffness, and flexibility, in addition to observing the crack growth. Additionally, imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and scanning lasers are employed to measure subtle deformations and characterize fractures in asphalt concrete. For instance, Hassan et al. [5] characterized the internal structural damage of asphalt concretes captured on X-ray CT images. Ajideh et al. [6] developed a scanning laser system designed to detect changes in surface properties for the purposes of monitoring damage and characterizing the fatigue behavior of asphalt concretes. While these methods can reflect the trend of crack onset and progression in asphalt concrete, they are inadequate in dynamically perceiving the entire damage process, which constrains their effectiveness in exploring the fracture behavior and mechanisms of concretes. In addition, researchers have employed various numerical simulation techniques, such as boundary element method (BEM), discrete element method (DEM) and finite element method (FEM), to identify crack initiation and propagation [7–11]. Specifically, Elseifi et al. [12] reviewed FEM method of modelling crack initiation and propagation in flexible pavements. Based on this review, a knowledge base has been established on how FEM can be effectively applied to predict pavement performance against cracking failure mechanisms. While these simulation methods are effective in certain scenarios, they may not always provide precise predictions of the fracture process, particularly in more complex or varying conditions. The accuracy of these models can be influenced by factors such as the simulation scale, the material model used, and the complexity of the concrete structure being analyzed.

To capture the complete damage process dynamically and accurately, DIC has been employed as an effective and versatile tool. It enhances the understanding of fracture behaviors in material structures by offering full-field, non-destructive, and detailed surface measurements of displacement and strain [13–15]. Seo et al. [16] compared the measurements of DIC against conventional linear variable differential transformers (LVDT), and found that DIC provides a more accurate determination of the stress–strain behavior due to its full-field and post-processing characteristics. DIC can offer a deformation map for the surface crack and measure displacement, allowing for the extraction of crack location and detection [17]. Zhu et al. [18] utilized DIC to evaluate crack initiation time, crack propagation rate, and horizontal strain through fatigue and bending fracture tests to study the self-healing properties of open-graded friction course (OGFC) asphalt concrete. Furthermore, DIC accurately measures strain fields in materials, detecting anomalies and damages. Doll et al. [19] employed DIC to estimate the FPZ in SCB specimens of asphalt concrete with a prefabricated notch through three-point bending tests by measuring the strain field around the crack tip. Bhowmik et al. [20] applied DIC to monitor the fracture process of concrete under different loading conditions and proposed a systematic method to understand the characteristics of the FPZ in concrete components. Overall, the ability of DIC to provide detailed information about crack growth and behavior renders it a valuable tool in the study and characterization of material cracks.

Compared with DIC, which focuses on surface deformation, AE technique offers superior capabilities in detecting internal damage and provides insights into internal processes as a precise and continuous non-destructive testing method. AE signals are the elastic waves propagating from the release of localized internal energy, such as microfractures in concrete. The AE technique, which detects these signals, is highly effective for real-time monitoring of damage progression and localizing fractures, thereby enabling the analysis of damage mechanisms [21–23]. Fundamentally, AE parameters have proven effective in evaluating concrete damage under various conditions [24,25]. Geng et al. [26] observed that the AE energy and ringing counts of concrete during the uniaxial compression test exhibited three distinct stages, which were found to align closely with the primary stages of deformation and failure. Further research based on AE parameters in the context of concrete structures is also emphasized for the analysis and evaluation of concrete failure processes, with the objective of comprehensive discrimination and characterization of the failure process. Typically, Ohtsu et al. [27] and Colombo et al. [28] employed b-value to evaluate the damage severity of concrete structures. Sagar et al. [29] analyzed the amplitude distribution of AE to study fracture propagation in concrete and mortar specimens, and indicated that b-value based on AE provides an effective method for identifying damage in concrete structural components. Additionally, a series of nonlinear theories and models were used to analyze the AE parameters and waveforms. For instance, a proposed methodology, based on the principles of fractal theory, has been put forward to forecast the progression of damage and the duration until structural failure. This methodology establishes a connection between the concepts of fracture mechanics and AE for structures that have been subjected to diffused damage [22]. Qiu et al. [30] conducted computations to determine the box-counting dimensions of different AE parameters, thus illustrating that the fractal dimension can consistently unveil the bending failure attributes of asphalt concrete. Ali et al. [31] indicated that the sudden decrease in the correlation dimension of AE signals enables to predict dynamic failures and microcrack mechanisms in coal and rock. Overall, AE techniques have proven highly effective in detecting and identifying crack initiation, monitoring crack propagation, and characterizing fracture mechanisms for concrete materials.

To comprehensively investigate the cracking behaviors and fracture mechanisms of asphalt concrete, it is crucial to consider both surface deformation and internal damage processes. The combined use of DIC and AE techniques has emerged as a powerful method, providing valuable insights into the initiation, propagation, and failure mechanisms of fractures, making them indispensable tools in material science and engineering research [32–34]. Li et al. [35] explored damage and failure of rubberized self-compacting concrete (RSCC) when subjected to uniaxial tension, employing both AE and DIC methods. Guo et al. [36] examined the fracture behavior of beams made from recycled concrete under three-point bending conditions, through the simultaneous application of DIC and AE methodologies. The combination allows for simultaneous temporal (time-based) monitoring of cracking events (AE) and spatial (location-based) analysis of deformation (DIC), which is significant for understanding the dynamics of fracture processes in concrete. The combined use of DIC and AE has shown promise in the study of materials, but more research is still needed to fully explore its potential. Most existing research focuses on specific types of materials, and it is necessary to understand how the combined use of DIC and AE can be applied to a wider range of materials, particularly asphalt concretes with different viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, while both DIC and AE offer insights into material damage, their relationship is still not fully understood. Further investigation utilizing the correlation between the results of these two techniques studies is needed to respond to the material properties and mechanical characteristics. Therefore, the objective of this study is to comprehensively understand the fracture behaviors and characteristics of three types of asphalt concrete by employing DIC and AE technologies. Furthermore, the study seeks to explore the relationship between surface deformation and internal damage in asphalt concrete. Specifically, this paper aims to:

(1) Evaluate the cracking resistance of asphalt concretes by the work of fracture, considering the variations in viscoelastic properties of asphalt material.   
(2) Identify the damage stages during the fracture process based on the variation of crack tip opening displacement and delineate FPZ and TFZ development to understand the inelastic deformation and nonlinear crack growth.   
(3) Analyze the temporal evolution characteristics of AE activity to explore the characteristic patterns of concrete damage and cracking behavior through the view of internal damage.   
(4) Discuss the relationship between surface deformation and internal damage evolution during the fracture process by quantifying the correlation between CTOD and AE parameters, and evaluate the effect of asphalt types on cracking resistance.   
(5) Explore diagnostic methods to identify critical damage conditions, including the formation of macroscopic cracks and fracture failure, using fractal dimension and b-value analysis.
