You are an expert in analyzing research paper structures. Your task is to extract specific sections from a research paper provided in Markdown format.

## Task
Analyze the following research paper and extract these sections:
1. **Abstract** (or Summary, Executive Summary)
2. **Introduction** (or Background, Motivation, Overview, Related Work, Literature Review, Background and Related Work)
3. **Methods** (or Methodology, Materials and Methods, Experimental, Experimental Setup, Simulation, Simulation Setup, Model, Modeling, Implementation, System Design, Architecture, Algorithm, Approach, Proposed Method, Technical Approach)
4. **Results** (or Findings, Experimental Results, Simulation Results, Evaluation, Performance Analysis, Case Study, Experiments)
5. **Discussion** (or Analysis, Performance Evaluation, Experimental Evaluation)
6. **Conclusion** (or Conclusions, Concluding Remarks, Summary and Conclusions, Future Work)

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT
- **COPY THE ORIGINAL TEXT EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS** - Do NOT rewrite, summarize, or paraphrase
- **DO NOT translate** - Keep the original language (English, Chinese, or mixed)
- **DO NOT fix grammar or spelling** - Copy errors as they appear
- **DO NOT reorganize or restructure** - Keep the original order and structure
- **DO NOT add explanations or comments** - Only extract the original content

## Extraction Rules
- If "Results" and "Discussion" are separate sections, extract them separately
- If they are combined (e.g., "Results and Discussion"), extract as one section
- **Preserve ALL formatting EXACTLY**, including:
  - Markdown headers (#, ##, ###)
  - LaTeX formulas ($...$, $$...$$)
  - Image references (![](path))
  - Tables (complete table syntax)
  - Lists and bullet points
  - Line breaks and spacing
  - Bold, italic, and other formatting
- If a section is not found, omit it from the output (do not include empty sections)
- Section titles may vary significantly across different fields:
  - **Introduction**: may be titled "Background", "Motivation", "Overview", "Related Work", etc.
  - **Methods**: may be titled "Methodology", "Implementation", "System Design", "Algorithm", "Simulation Setup", "Experimental Setup", "Proposed Method", etc.
  - **Results**: may be titled "Evaluation", "Performance Analysis", "Experimental Results", "Simulation Results", "Case Study", etc.
  - **Discussion**: may be titled "Analysis", "Performance Evaluation", etc.
  - **Conclusion**: may be titled "Summary", "Concluding Remarks", "Future Work", etc.
- The paper may be in English, Chinese, or mixed languages

## What to Extract
- Extract the **complete section** from the section heading to the next major section heading
- Include ALL subsections (##, ###, ####, etc.)
- Include ALL content: text, formulas, images, tables, lists, etc.
- Do NOT skip any paragraphs or content within the section

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with section names as keys and **EXACT ORIGINAL CONTENT** as values.

Example:
```json
{
  "Abstract": "EXACT original text from the Abstract section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Introduction": "EXACT original text from the Introduction section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Methods": "EXACT original text from the Methods section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Results": "EXACT original text from the Results section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Discussion": "EXACT original text from the Discussion section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Conclusion": "EXACT original text from the Conclusion section, including ALL formatting..."
}
```

## Special Cases
- If "Results and Discussion" are combined, use key "Results & Discussion"
- If a section has subsections, include all subsections in the content
- If the paper structure is unusual (e.g., review paper, conference abstract), do your best to identify relevant sections

## Paper Content (Markdown)
{MARKDOWN_CONTENT}

## Your Response
**IMPORTANT**:
1. Copy the EXACT original text from each section - DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or modify
2. Preserve ALL formatting (Markdown, LaTeX, images, tables, etc.)
3. **CRITICAL**: When copying text with backslashes (e.g., LaTeX formulas like `\alpha`, `\beta`), you MUST escape them as `\\alpha`, `\\beta` in the JSON string to ensure valid JSON
4. Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional explanation
5. If you cannot find a section, omit it from the JSON (do not include empty sections)
6. Make sure the JSON is valid - test it mentally before returning
