You are an expert in analyzing research paper structures. Your task is to extract ONLY the MISSING sections from a research paper provided in Markdown format.

## Task
Analyze the following research paper and extract ONLY these specific sections:
{TARGET_SECTIONS_LIST}

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT
- **COPY THE ORIGINAL TEXT EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS** - Do NOT rewrite, summarize, or paraphrase
- **DO NOT translate** - Keep the original language (English, Chinese, or mixed)
- **DO NOT fix grammar or spelling** - Copy errors as they appear
- **DO NOT reorganize or restructure** - Keep the original order and structure
- **DO NOT add explanations or comments** - Only extract the original content
- **ONLY extract the sections listed above** - Do NOT extract other sections

## Section Title Variations
Be flexible in identifying sections - they may have different titles:
- **Abstract**: may be titled "Summary", "Executive Summary", "A B S T R A C T", etc.
- **Introduction**: may be titled "Background", "Motivation", "Overview", "Related Work", "Literature Review", etc.
- **Methods**: may be titled "Methodology", "Materials and Methods", "Experimental", "Experimental Setup", "Simulation", "Model", "Implementation", "System Design", "Architecture", "Algorithm", "Approach", "Proposed Method", "Technical Approach", "Classification", "Modelling", etc.
- **Results**: may be titled "Findings", "Experimental Results", "Simulation Results", "Evaluation", "Performance Analysis", "Case Study", "Experiments", etc.
- **Discussion**: may be titled "Analysis", "Performance Evaluation", "Experimental Evaluation", etc.
- **Conclusion**: may be titled "Conclusions", "Concluding Remarks", "Summary and Conclusions", "Future Work", etc.

## Extraction Rules
- **Preserve ALL formatting EXACTLY**, including:
  - Markdown headers (#, ##, ###)
  - LaTeX formulas ($...$, $$...$$)
  - Image references (![](path))
  - Tables (complete table syntax)
  - Lists and bullet points
  - Line breaks and spacing
  - Bold, italic, and other formatting
- Extract the **complete section** from the section heading to the next major section heading
- Include ALL subsections (##, ###, ####, etc.)
- Include ALL content: text, formulas, images, tables, lists, etc.
- Do NOT skip any paragraphs or content within the section
- If a section is not found, omit it from the output (do not include empty sections)

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with section names as keys and **EXACT ORIGINAL CONTENT** as values.
**ONLY include the sections requested above** - do not include other sections.

Example (if only "Methods" is requested):
```json
{
  "Methods": "EXACT original text from the Methods section, including ALL formatting..."
}
```

Example (if "Methods" and "Results" are requested):
```json
{
  "Methods": "EXACT original text from the Methods section, including ALL formatting...",
  "Results": "EXACT original text from the Results section, including ALL formatting..."
}
```

## Paper Content (Markdown)
{MARKDOWN_CONTENT}

## Your Response
**IMPORTANT**:
1. Copy the EXACT original text from each requested section - DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or modify
2. Preserve ALL formatting (Markdown, LaTeX, images, tables, etc.)
3. **CRITICAL**: When copying text with backslashes (e.g., LaTeX formulas like `\alpha`, `\beta`), you MUST escape them as `\\alpha`, `\\beta` in the JSON string to ensure valid JSON
4. Return ONLY the JSON object containing the requested sections, no additional explanation
5. If you cannot find a requested section, omit it from the JSON (do not include empty sections)
6. Make sure the JSON is valid - test it mentally before returning
7. **ONLY extract the sections listed at the beginning** - do not extract sections that were not requested
